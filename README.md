# Predictive Modeling for Assessing Drunk Driving Propensity: Analyzing Age, Gender, Alcohol, and Cigarette Usage Factors

Utilizing data collected from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) from 1996, I aim to construct a predictive model assessing the probability of individuals driving under the influence, considering variables like gender, alcohol consumption, weight, work status, and cigarette use.

### Dataset Preparation
We began our data preparation process by accessing the National Survey on Drug Use and Health 1996 dataset. In R, we retrieved the dataset and proceeded to identify our variables of interest. Utilizing R, we crafted a subset tailored to our specific criteria and downloaded the refined dataset in an Excel format for further analysis. Through R-based computations, we established a new sample size (N=18,269). The variables of interest included demographic factors such as age, sex, race, and education, along with behavioral aspects including alcohol and cigarette usage patterns, work status, height, weight, overall health, and various alcohol-related metrics such as frequency of use and initiation age. The focus of our analysis rested on the dependent variable, specifically the number of days an individual drove under the influence in the past 30 days.

### Analytic Tools
R served as the primary tool for data file conversions, cleaning, manipulation, and descriptive analysis throughout this study. Python was utilized specifically for the creation of the prediction model.
